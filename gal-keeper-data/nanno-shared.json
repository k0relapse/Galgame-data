      "description": "In the distant future, a gigantic energy mass called the \"Star of Destruction\" suddenly appears near Mars. Its presence causes abnormal weather and tectonic plate shifts on Earth. As resources become scarce and populations have nowhere to go, conflicts erupt worldwide. This, however, is merely an omen of things to come.\n\nOnly a hundred years remain for humanity. They plan to evacuate the planet to evade its doom. Two projects are drafted to meet that end.\n\nFirst is the establishment of Earth's Unified Government, which will allow the project to be implemented. Evacuating Earth becomes a top priority, and the order of \"sacrificing the few to save the many\" is implemented. Authoritarian rule controls the masses. Armed force oversees states and non-governmental organizations that oppose the new world order. The overwhelming military power maintains order regarding race, religion, food, energy, etc.\n\nThe second is the \"Felix Project,\" which will serve as the foundation for the exodus plan. With only 100 years left, humanity needs to build a spaceship to leave the planet and acquire the technology to survive in the vacuum of space for a long time. They decided to create \"Felix,\" genetically modified people with extraordinary intelligence and longevity. These \"superhumans\" will be able to complete the seemingly impossible project.\n\n99 years pass.\nA lone female Felix, Sion, has served her role as the central figure in the Earth Evacuation Project. With her job completed, Sion wishes to spend her remaining time quietly on the abandoned Earth. A young man, Ryo Haruna, from the unified military, is deployed to her side to protect and keep her in check.\n\nTheir meeting sets the story in motion.\nThe final love story on Earth.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=http://www.minori.ph/lineup/eden_/story.html/]official site[/url]]",

      "description": "Satoru and his younger sister Sora had to find a new place to live when their parents decided to go on a long trip and also renovate the house at the same time. They ended up at the \"Dream House\". With an open-concept design, a spacious interior, a large pool with jacuzzi, as well as an outdoor bath with a mountain view, it’s everything you could have wanted from a home. The landlord Kei welcomed them and the three other residents Yogiri, Miyako and Suzu: “Perversion is something you should hide, but not something you should be ashamed of!”. Satoru immediately refuted that they were perverts, but he did not yet know at that time that the girls all had hidden fetishes.\n\n[From [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/september-2012-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Springtime.\n\nThe season of cherry blossoms, and a time of new beginnings, new encounters, and new people. For Aoba Kyousuke, this new season marks the start of his second year in high school, and after taking a moment to reflect and looking at the friends around him...All he can find is a dumbass too horny for his own good, and can't get over his strange fetish for lizard-humanoid creatures.\n\nSure enough, he enjoys hanging out with them, and he wouldn't even think of giving it up, but something feels missing. A precious, valuable part of everyone's adolescence, and something he might  just miss out on at this rate...\n\nWhat is that something? Why, love of course. So upon realizing this, he shouts to the world-\n\n\"I WANT A GIRLFRIEND!\"\n\nHe'll need to give it his all, of course, because he knows that love does not just come to those who wait.\n\n[From [url=https://fureraba.nekonyansoft.com/] NekoNyan[/url]]",

He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements.\n\nIt's December, and the first snow of the year has fallen. In one lot of the old town, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress. She's wandering the streets under the falling snow, in search of her rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress, Sakura, transfers into his school, in order to take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.\n\nWith the turn of the four seasons, 1095 days come to an end. Soon winter will pass, and spring will arrive. Embracing memories of snow that never accumulated, the youth stands perfectly still.\n\nFrom the first snow (Hatsuyuki) to cherry blossoms (Sakura), congratulations on your graduation.",

As our fingers touch, her sweet, gentle aura feels almost palpable—so soft and fluffy, like a marshmallow…\n\nKanon: “Welcome to our humble pâtisserie!”\n\nThe next thing I know, we’re standing outside a cute cake shop called Marshmallow Tree where, as luck would have it, she’s the new owner… and is hiring me as a full-time, live-in employee!\nAnd so begins my second lease on life—as a worker at a cake shop. Sure, business isn’t exactly booming here, but we’re dead set on fixing that, whatever it takes.\n\nSlowly but surely, and with a whole lot of love and support from new neighbors and friends, more and more customers finally start flocking in. And yet… why does our growing success only lead to more awkwardness and averted gazes from my coworkers…?\n\nUshio: “Check it out, I baked this new cake with you as the inspiration.”\nSasa: “I’m so sorry for trying to spoon-feed you! I know I’m about as charming as yogurt on a yogurt lid… Eeep!”\nRaiha: “There’s a Japanese saying that a real man never turns down a ‘good meal.’ Care to walk me through it? Teehee!”\nKanon: “Isn’t it amazing we get along so swimmingly? Keep up the fantastic work, guys! We’ll have this place full of smiles and laughter in no time!”\n\n…Well, whatever happens, I guess this really does mark the start of a new, dare I say \"marshmallowy\" chapter in my life… Hmm, which sweet, fluffy flavor shall I choose?\n\n[From [url=https://shiravune.com/archives/2048]Shiravune[/url]]",

Her magical-girl powers easily vanquish the enemy, but a surprise ambush forces her to dive in harm’s way to shield him—leaving both fatally wounded. Luckily, Miss Fujiko arrives on the scene with an enchanted thread to bind both their life forces, saving them from certain death.\n\nOver the next three months as Seiji and Yuuri slowly recover, the pair are on doctor’s orders to stay within one meter of each other or risk snapping their “red string of fate.” This means shacking up together and pretending to be a couple to avoid their classmates’ suspicions, but despite the clueless Yuuri claiming to be a “one-woman fortress with zero openings,” her natural powers of seduction quickly result in awkward situations that test poor Seiji’s sanity and self-control...\n\nWith his dream girl only centimeters away at every waking moment, will Seiji finally summon the courage to shoot his shot?\n\n\n[From [url=https://www.johren.games/games/download/destiny-star-girlfriend-en-zh//]Johren[/url]]",

It takes place before the main event of [url=http://vndb.org/v4028]Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate[/url]. \n\nRikuto had a new younger brother Ayumu after his father’s remarriage. However, little did he know that Ayumu was actually his younger sister and it was under her mother’s orders that she pretend to be a boy to him. Every day, his heart beats a little faster around his overly cute ‘otouto’ (imouto), while her heart aches in having to hide her true identity from her kind brother.\n\nWith the arrival of spring, Rikuto and Ayumu begin attending the popular private school Asaoka Academy, with Ayumu dressed up as a girl. As he became friends with his classmates, he noticed that they all had something missing. His friend from middle school, Matsuri, has lost sight of what it meant to be a girl. The cool-mannered Mao dresses as a boy even though she is a girl. The extremely shy class rep Kimika wishes to change herself. With Ayumu by his side, he sets out to help them seek out what they are missing.\n\n[Edited from [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/december-2012-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Bottled-up emotions...\nAn everlasting oath...\nHeartfelt desires...\nAn enduring regret...\nAnd a childhood promise.\n\nYuuto was abandoned by his parents and raised in an orphanage in Britain before a trading merchant by the name of Takakura Yoshiomi adopted him and brought him to Japan.\n\nHe could barely speak the language, but he had the support and love of his two new sisters, the cheery yet shy Anzu, and the calm, collected Anri.\nDuring his time in elementary school, he also made new friends: the ingenuous and kind Tsubame, and the ostentatious but guarded Izumi.\n\nThey were young and oblivious to love back then. They laughed together, cried together, and nurtured irreplaceable bonds with one another.\n\nTen years later...\n\nThe landscape of the town has changed, and so have they.\n\nYet some things never do change, no matter how much time passes.\n\n\"Do you still remember the promise we made that day?\"\n\nTen years ago, during their childhood, there was another pair of twins that they all played with.\nHekiru and Hikaru reappear and the emotions that have since frozen in time are now rekindled.\nThis marks the beginning of their resplendent time together, their \"Clover Days.\"\n\n[From [url=http://cloverdays.nekonyansoft.com/story.html]NekoNyan[/url]]",

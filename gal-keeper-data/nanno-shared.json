      "description": "In the distant future, a gigantic energy mass called the \"Star of Destruction\" suddenly appears near Mars. Its presence causes abnormal weather and tectonic plate shifts on Earth. As resources become scarce and populations have nowhere to go, conflicts erupt worldwide. This, however, is merely an omen of things to come.\n\nOnly a hundred years remain for humanity. They plan to evacuate the planet to evade its doom. Two projects are drafted to meet that end.\n\nFirst is the establishment of Earth's Unified Government, which will allow the project to be implemented. Evacuating Earth becomes a top priority, and the order of \"sacrificing the few to save the many\" is implemented. Authoritarian rule controls the masses. Armed force oversees states and non-governmental organizations that oppose the new world order. The overwhelming military power maintains order regarding race, religion, food, energy, etc.\n\nThe second is the \"Felix Project,\" which will serve as the foundation for the exodus plan. With only 100 years left, humanity needs to build a spaceship to leave the planet and acquire the technology to survive in the vacuum of space for a long time. They decided to create \"Felix,\" genetically modified people with extraordinary intelligence and longevity. These \"superhumans\" will be able to complete the seemingly impossible project.\n\n99 years pass.\nA lone female Felix, Sion, has served her role as the central figure in the Earth Evacuation Project. With her job completed, Sion wishes to spend her remaining time quietly on the abandoned Earth. A young man, Ryo Haruna, from the unified military, is deployed to her side to protect and keep her in check.\n\nTheir meeting sets the story in motion.\nThe final love story on Earth.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=http://www.minori.ph/lineup/eden_/story.html/]official site[/url]]",

      "description": "Satoru and his younger sister Sora had to find a new place to live when their parents decided to go on a long trip and also renovate the house at the same time. They ended up at the \"Dream House\". With an open-concept design, a spacious interior, a large pool with jacuzzi, as well as an outdoor bath with a mountain view, it’s everything you could have wanted from a home. The landlord Kei welcomed them and the three other residents Yogiri, Miyako and Suzu: “Perversion is something you should hide, but not something you should be ashamed of!”. Satoru immediately refuted that they were perverts, but he did not yet know at that time that the girls all had hidden fetishes.\n\n[From [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/september-2012-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Springtime.\n\nThe season of cherry blossoms, and a time of new beginnings, new encounters, and new people. For Aoba Kyousuke, this new season marks the start of his second year in high school, and after taking a moment to reflect and looking at the friends around him...All he can find is a dumbass too horny for his own good, and can't get over his strange fetish for lizard-humanoid creatures.\n\nSure enough, he enjoys hanging out with them, and he wouldn't even think of giving it up, but something feels missing. A precious, valuable part of everyone's adolescence, and something he might  just miss out on at this rate...\n\nWhat is that something? Why, love of course. So upon realizing this, he shouts to the world-\n\n\"I WANT A GIRLFRIEND!\"\n\nHe'll need to give it his all, of course, because he knows that love does not just come to those who wait.\n\n[From [url=https://fureraba.nekonyansoft.com/] NekoNyan[/url]]",

He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements.\n\nIt's December, and the first snow of the year has fallen. In one lot of the old town, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress. She's wandering the streets under the falling snow, in search of her rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress, Sakura, transfers into his school, in order to take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.\n\nWith the turn of the four seasons, 1095 days come to an end. Soon winter will pass, and spring will arrive. Embracing memories of snow that never accumulated, the youth stands perfectly still.\n\nFrom the first snow (Hatsuyuki) to cherry blossoms (Sakura), congratulations on your graduation.",

As our fingers touch, her sweet, gentle aura feels almost palpable—so soft and fluffy, like a marshmallow…\n\nKanon: “Welcome to our humble pâtisserie!”\n\nThe next thing I know, we’re standing outside a cute cake shop called Marshmallow Tree where, as luck would have it, she’s the new owner… and is hiring me as a full-time, live-in employee!\nAnd so begins my second lease on life—as a worker at a cake shop. Sure, business isn’t exactly booming here, but we’re dead set on fixing that, whatever it takes.\n\nSlowly but surely, and with a whole lot of love and support from new neighbors and friends, more and more customers finally start flocking in. And yet… why does our growing success only lead to more awkwardness and averted gazes from my coworkers…?\n\nUshio: “Check it out, I baked this new cake with you as the inspiration.”\nSasa: “I’m so sorry for trying to spoon-feed you! I know I’m about as charming as yogurt on a yogurt lid… Eeep!”\nRaiha: “There’s a Japanese saying that a real man never turns down a ‘good meal.’ Care to walk me through it? Teehee!”\nKanon: “Isn’t it amazing we get along so swimmingly? Keep up the fantastic work, guys! We’ll have this place full of smiles and laughter in no time!”\n\n…Well, whatever happens, I guess this really does mark the start of a new, dare I say \"marshmallowy\" chapter in my life… Hmm, which sweet, fluffy flavor shall I choose?\n\n[From [url=https://shiravune.com/archives/2048]Shiravune[/url]]",

Her magical-girl powers easily vanquish the enemy, but a surprise ambush forces her to dive in harm’s way to shield him—leaving both fatally wounded. Luckily, Miss Fujiko arrives on the scene with an enchanted thread to bind both their life forces, saving them from certain death.\n\nOver the next three months as Seiji and Yuuri slowly recover, the pair are on doctor’s orders to stay within one meter of each other or risk snapping their “red string of fate.” This means shacking up together and pretending to be a couple to avoid their classmates’ suspicions, but despite the clueless Yuuri claiming to be a “one-woman fortress with zero openings,” her natural powers of seduction quickly result in awkward situations that test poor Seiji’s sanity and self-control...\n\nWith his dream girl only centimeters away at every waking moment, will Seiji finally summon the courage to shoot his shot?\n\n\n[From [url=https://www.johren.games/games/download/destiny-star-girlfriend-en-zh//]Johren[/url]]",

      "description": "This is the all-ages debut title by fairys, the sister company of sprite. It takes place before the main event of [url=http://vndb.org/v4028]Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate[/url]. \n\nRikuto had a new younger brother Ayumu after his father’s remarriage. However, little did he know that Ayumu was actually his younger sister and it was under her mother’s orders that she pretend to be a boy to him. Every day, his heart beats a little faster around his overly cute ‘otouto’ (imouto), while her heart aches in having to hide her true identity from her kind brother.\n\nWith the arrival of spring, Rikuto and Ayumu begin attending the popular private school Asaoka Academy, with Ayumu dressed up as a girl. As he became friends with his classmates, he noticed that they all had something missing. His friend from middle school, Matsuri, has lost sight of what it meant to be a girl. The cool-mannered Mao dresses as a boy even though she is a girl. The extremely shy class rep Kimika wishes to change herself.

      "description": "Bottled-up emotions...\nAn everlasting oath...\nHeartfelt desires...\nAn enduring regret...\nAnd a childhood promise.\n\nYuuto was abandoned by his parents and raised in an orphanage in Britain before a trading merchant by the name of Takakura Yoshiomi adopted him and brought him to Japan.\n\nHe could barely speak the language, but he had the support and love of his two new sisters, the cheery yet shy Anzu, and the calm, collected Anri.\nDuring his time in elementary school, he also made new friends: the ingenuous and kind Tsubame, and the ostentatious but guarded Izumi.\n\nThey were young and oblivious to love back then. They laughed together, cried together, and nurtured irreplaceable bonds with one another.\n\nTen years later...\n\nThe landscape of the town has changed, and so have they.\n\nYet some things never do change, no matter how much time passes.\n\n\"Do you still remember the promise we made that day?\"\n\nTen years ago, during their childhood, there was another pair of twins that they all played with.\nHekiru and Hikaru reappear and the emotions that have since frozen in time are now rekindled.\nThis marks the beginning of their resplendent time together, their \"Clover Days.\"\n\n[From [url=http://cloverdays.nekonyansoft.com/story.html]NekoNyan[/url]]",

It was an overly common battle tale. However, no one thanked or praised them for their victory. In fact, no one even knew them at all. Even so, the future of humanity was protected and it came to a happy end.\n\nNow around ten years later, it was spring, the season of meetings and farewells. Those who had once saved the world have forgotten ‘magic’ and lived as normal girls with ordinary encounters and problems. Taiga was approached by the transfer student Haru, who made a request of him:\n\n“Please turn me back into a mahou shoujo.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2019/01/01/january-2019-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

With it, he can heal any and all wounds.\nBut it comes at the cost of the memories he's made.\nHe lives a simple life: going to school and being scolded by his childhood friend, Kisaragi Mio, by day, and working with his master, Natsume Suzu, in the evenings.\nHowever, whenever he falls asleep, he always sees the same dream... a white world, feathers falling, and a girl calling out for him to save her.\nThe student dormitory his master resides in has a special door in the basement, which connects their world to a myriad of different parallel ones. He travels from world to world, searching for one that resembles the scenery he sees in his dreams, but to no avail.\n\nThen, one night, as he's out at night strolling around town, he spots a girl jumping from the lighthouse.\nYuuma rushes over and heals her using his power, but after coming to, the girl claims to know him and his power, and asks him much like the voice in his dreams:\n\n\"Please save me, Kanoue Yuuma.\"\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591380/Irotoridori_No_Sekai_HD__The_Colorful_World/]Steam[/url]]",

That was until one winter day when the sakura began to bloom. All the news club members got a message on their cell phones telling them to do something at a promised place when the sakura begins to bloom. They couldn’t make out the rest of the message, but are surprised that it was dated 1951. Rikka was extremely curious about the message and the sudden blooming of the sakura, so she called on everyone to solve the mystery with her.\n \n[Edited from [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/april-2012-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "[b]Days Chasing Glory[/b]\n\nIn this world, the sun shines brightest on the privileged, leaving the rest to shiver in the shadows. Capitalism has stacked the deck, ensuring that the elites monopolize wealth, education, and the luxury of living without fear. Yet, amid this rigged game, one boy dares to defy the odds.\n\nFuwano Nagi knows this reality all too well. Born in the slums, he's destined for a life of hardship. But then, a rare opportunity lands in his hands:\n\n[b][One's Gift][/b]\n\nAn invitation to Ougen Academy—a school that guarantees a place in the winner’s circle. Each year, one lucky student receives this offer, no matter their background. For a slum kid like Nagi, it’s his ticket out—a shot to rewrite his fate.\n\nBut there’s a catch. This school is like a predator's den, and the students are circling, ready to tear him apart.\n\nAt the top of the food chain? The student council, the elite of the elite:\n\n-Isshiki Kaname: The charismatic student council president. She's the heir to a powerful family that secretly pulls the strings in Japan.\n-Tateshina Eve: Aikido master and smooth operator. Cunning and resourceful, rumor has it she's a secret agent for the National Police Agency.\n-Yato Kukuru: Tech prodigy with a bottomless bank account. She's got brains, ambition, and the funds to make it big.\n\nWith Touri, his surrogate sister from the slums, by his side, Nagi dives headfirst into this pit of vipers. Can he claw his way to the top and claim his own glory? Or will the privileged elite crush him before he even begins?\n\n[Translated and edited from the [url=https://selectoblige.com/story]official website[/url]]",

She lives alone except for her pet dog Qoo, and she holds down a part-time job as a waitress at Dragon Burger. Her life is busy and content, but sometimes she feels like there's something she's forgetting, something she left undone. Maybe even something important.\n\nOne day Alice and her friends visit the clock tower. There, an unusual book falls into Alice's lap: the diary of a mysterious and rather perverted young man. Why do all the girls Alice meets show up in the diary? Why does nobody remember the events in the diary? And why does Alice feel so strongly that she wants to meet that young man?",

      "description": "“Just like how you can’t change my heart, you won’t be able to change the future”\n\nThat phrase is what Ren said to Riku, as she handed him a clock that can turn back time. That was five years ago, and Riku is now a full-fledged adult who is traveling all over Japan to “help” the people in need with this strange artifact. Despite Ren’s words that he cannot “change what has already happened”, Riku was determined to prove her wrong, and used the power of the clock for years… with no success.\n\nAs he arrived in another town looking for a place to stay while he works to “help others”, an apple rolls down from the hill. He is only able to catch one as many others passes him by, and even if he uses the clock to wind back time to see if he can catch any more than one, the apples defy physics and he ends up only being able to catch just one apple.\n\nThe owner of the apples, Shino, then comes to thank him for his help. To Riku’s surprise, the girl is stunningly similar to the person who once Riku loved, and hiding his surprise, he somehow receives the girl’s help to get used to the new town.\n\nRiku will never be able to guess that this encounter will change his viewpoint of everything\nAnd thus starts the story of Riku in this small town with a strange girl named Shino.\n\n[From [url=http://vnerogereview.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/i-will-endure-pain-for-you-again-and-again-review-of-140829dekinai-watashiga-kurekaesu/]Visual Novels and Eroge Review[/url]]",

      "description": "This is the debut game for Uguisu Kagura, which succeeds Yonaki Uguisu. There was a small library on that island. It was the Yuugyouji family’s private library built solely for one girl, Yoruko, who didn’t attend school and spent all her time there. With lots of intriguing books on its shelves, there was no happier place for a bookworm like her. There were also other wonderful and pleasant people who resided there: the protagonist Ruri and his cool sharp-tongued imouto Kisaki, the freeloading tennen moodmaker Rio, and the curious and honest “detective” Kanata. It’s as if they were all brought together by someone or something. Their love of books was the beginning of their youth. Before long, the lonely library became full of light and they became close like childhood friends.\n\nTwo years later, Ruri returned to the library after leaving the island due to family matters. Nothing seemed to have changed from six years ago, except that there was a secret which they were not aware of back then: “Anything that is written in the magic book will become reality”. If it’s a romance novel, then a miracle-like love story will unfold. If it’s a fantasy novel, then vampires will appear the next day. If it’s a horror novel, then there’ll be a ghost beckoning you from behind.\n\nYoruko’s strong will. Kisaki’s beauty. Rio’s cheerfulness. Kanata’s brilliance. Let’s fall in love with them and books.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2014/12/18/december-2014-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Set in Hinomoto, a fictional version of Japan, where railway travel served as the primary form of transport for a long time. Each locomotive was paired with a humanoid control module, so-called Raillord, that aided the train operator. However, many rail lines had been discontinued due to the rising popularity of ‘aerocrafts,’ a safe and convenient aerial mode of transport. As such, their accompanying Raillords also went into a deep sleep.\n\nSoutetsu had lost his entire family in a rail accident and was adopted into the Migita household, which runs a shochu brewery in Ohitoyo city. He returned to his hometown to save it from the potential water pollution if they accepted the proposal to build an aerocraft factory nearby. He woke up the Raillord Hachiroku by accident and became her owner. They agreed to help find her lost locomotive for different purposes, with the help of his stepsister Hibiki, the town’s mayor and local railway chief, Paulette, and others.\n\n[Translated from [url=http://www.lose.jp/maitetsu/story.html]Official Site[/url]]",

Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, Flying Circus, which used shoes to make players compete in the open sky. \n\nHinata Masaya, who was once considered a prodigy, turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...\n\nHowever, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Kurashina Asuka, how to fly.\n\nThis time, Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but as a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, he and his team decided to challenge the top student-athletes in Japan.\n\nNow, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?\n\nThis is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://aokana.nekonyansoft.com/story.html]NekoNyan[/url]]",

They met the three sisters Haru, Kotose and Yukina, who run the cafe “Famille”, and he starts working there in exchange for a bed to sleep in.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Shou follows Haru far away from the town to a hill covered with flowers as far as the eye could see. He watched as a little girl whom Haru was embracing turned into a flower under the large moonlit tree. She noticed his presence and smiled lonesomely while looking fondly at the beautiful flowers in full bloom.\n\n“I have survived up till now in this world by doing this. But I still want to continue living… even if it’s in exchange for other people’s lives.”\n\nShou looked up at the petals which fluttered down and responded:\n\n“No matter what this world forces upon you, no matter how many people won’t forgive you... I’ll still pray for this world to end.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/november-2016-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

His parents did the same, and they are his role model. This was his dream… Well, was to be his dream at least\n\nSaika hears of a bad news from his uncle (Ion), however, that…\n“Filia Academy Designer School will restrict males from next year”\n\nWith such a shocking news in mind, Saika considers his options.\nHowever, he understands his status now, and decides to throw away his history as a male and attend this school.\n\nThis is because if he attends under a master, he will be able to hide his true identity and attend as a simple “servant”.\nTherefore Saika borrows the name “Kokura Asahi” (spelled different in Japanese) and becomes the maid of “Est”.\n\nGetting into the school is the easy part: the real difficulty is from now. Even with the best outfit, walking down the runway alone isn’t sufficient.\n\nFashion, Acting, and Music all need to be considered when getting on stage.\nSo Saika (aka, Asahi) will become closer with the girls from the 66-story apartment he prepared named “Sakura no En” (Paradise of Cherry Blossoms)\n\nWill Saika be able to find a perfect partner while hiding his identity and receive the highest prize at the Academy Show?\n\n[From [url=http://vnerogereview.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/basic-information-on-141031-tsukiyori-2/]Visual Novels and Eroge Review[/url]]",

      "description": "This is the sequel to Tsuki ni Yorisou Otome no Sahou, taking place in Paris with imouto Resona as the main heroine. It continues from the bad ending in the original game, with Resona and Yuusei moving to Paris to attend École de Philia girl’s school after he could not longer attend the one in Japan. Once again he dresses up as the maid Asahi, although this time serving Resona. He gradually meets other girls there: the pure Meryl with promising talent, the welcoming ojousama Bluette, classmate Liliane, and fellow foreign student Dietlinde. Yuusei/Asahi chases after his dream, while Resona wishes for the courage to be independent. But can they achieve those goals in a difficult new world and their older brother possibly after them?\n\nIn addition to the new story, the limited edition version includes after story of the 4 main heroines. Luna, Minato, Ursule, and Mizuho also appear as subcharacters.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/july-2013-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "The village of Hoori lies deep in the middle of the mountains, inaccessible by rail. Since there isn’t much interaction with its surroundings, the town seems like it is stuck in the past. However, it is because of this exact olden feel and subsequent development that it has turned into a nice hot-springs town for tourists.\n\nOne of the popular sightseeing spots is the legendary katana Murasamemaru, embedded in stone. No one has been able to pull it out… until Masaomi somehow broke it in half. He has to take responsibility for his actions: “Marriage” with ‘shrine maiden princess’ Yoshino!? He was perplexed at the unexpected turn of events, but this is only just the beginning. What lies ahead for him is a much more peculiar and mysterious life, including his new fiancée, a mysterious girl who only he could touch, and the secret behind the curse that remains on the town.\n\nWhat will become of Masaomi’s love amidst his rapidly changing life? The answer lies within the Murasamemaru in his hands.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/july-2016-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

The two of them had nothing to do with one another beyond just being classmates, until one day, when Shuuji stumbled upon a scene that defied his wildest imaginations. Ayachi Nene, THAT Ayachi Nene is pressing her crotch against the corner of a library table… using it to MASTURBATE?!\n\nFollowing that one accident, two strangers became friends. They bonded with one another through their shared secrets, and from this, Shuuji came to learn about certain things. That is, not only about the reason for Nene’s random ‘fits’ where she gets uncontrollably aroused, but also about the existence of people called ‘witches’—-Nene’s secret actions as a ‘witch’, and the ‘fits’ she goes through because of that serving as the magnet, a junior, an upperclassman, and a transfer student all congregate together.\n\nShuuji’s once normal life is thrown into chaos, and with that, a certain faint hope wells up inside of him:\n\n“Maybe this will be the start of something new.”\n\n[From [url=https://sanobawitch.nekonyansoft.com/]NekoNyan[/url]]",

      "description": "It began as a day just like any other.\nA dull morning, an uneventful trip to school, an afternoon of tedious lectures...\nAnd then I met her.\n\n\"I'm an angel, sent here from Heaven on a very important mission.\"\n\nShe appeared suddenly, and without warning―a beautiful girl who called herself an angel.\nSpreading her large, snow-white wings, she made a declaration that would forever change my life.\n\n\"I come in search of the Demon Lord's reincarnation.\"\n\"That being you, Tanikaze Riku.\"\n\nThat's right, apparently I was a Demon Lord in my previous life. From some other world to boot.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the anarchy wouldn't stop there.\nMemories from a previous life, visitors from another world... It was just one crazy, chaotic event after the other.\n\n\"Wait, what? But that doesn't― Huh?!\"\n\nThus began the story of Tanikaze Riku, a tale marked by the loss of his normal life, along with so many other precious things.\nAside from even more anarchy, what else does the future have in store for him?\n\n[From [url=https://twitter.com/NekoNyanSoft/status/1600911481184595973]NekoNyan's official Twitter[/url]]",

Due to an unforeseen event, his true identity was revealed to Mitsukasa Ayase!\nBut the revelations didn't stop there; Ayase's own big secret was also revealed:\n\nWhat do you know! Her chest was padded!\n\nThe two now held each other's unspeakable secrets within them.\nAnd with that one encounter, their fate would be forever changed--\n\n[Based on translation from [url=https://www.yuzu-soft.com/products/riddle/story.html]Developer's site[/url]]",

And what's more, when he woke up, it was the morning of the very day he had died. He proceeded to relive the same day, unable to grasp the reality of his situation. Kousei soon realized that his previous experience was not some prophetic dream, nor was he experiencing deja vu; everything was taking place the exact same way. \n\nOverwhelmed by fear due to the unbelievable situation he has found himself in, he came back to the place where he had died. Then, at the moment of the accident, Kousei met a death goddess accompanied by a talking cat. The death goddess informed him that he has not yet avoided his death. In order to escape his grisly fate, Kousei must assist the death goddess with her work. And naturally, this means the opening of a café together. \n\nBy rewinding the world, Kousei may have overcome his fate for now, but can he overcome the certain death his future holds for him? This is the story of one man's love and his defiance of the world and his own fate... maybe?\n\n[Source: [url=https://stella.nekonyansoft.com/story.html]NekoNyan website[/url]]",

When a large earthquake struck the university town of Shiromitsugawa, the sacred treasure in the Hakuda Tsukumo Shrine was damaged, and mysterious objects called \"artifacts\" began to appear from a parallel world. These artifacts granted special abilities to those who possessed them.\n\nThere was an incident where someone abused these powers and turned people into stone. Kakeru, who has a strong sense of responsibility, lent his assistance to Miyako in seeking the culprit. His innocent little sister, Sora, also joins them in investigating the serial petrification incidents as they unveil a mysterious group and hidden feelings.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/april-2018-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

      "description": "This is the third game in Palette’s 9-nine- series. Shiromitsugawa was a nondescript university town until a large earthquake damaged the sacred treasure of the local shrine and mysterious objects called 'artifacts' started appearing from a parallel world, granting special powers to those who possessed them.\n\nKakeru, his classmate Miyako, and imouto Sora investigated the petrification incidents and discovered that the culprit was the owner of the 'Evil Eye' artifact. Along the way, they came across a rival group of artifact users who called themselves Rig Veda, and one of its members was his senpai that he sees every morning, Haruka.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2019/04/28/april-2019-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Shinra and his younger sister Ren have the ability to transfer ‘pain’ on to themselves by touching someone. Ever since they were young, they have been used by their foster parents for this ability. Tired of constantly moving from place to place, they decided to leave together to the rural mountain village of Tenryou-mura with the intention of not using their powers again. Even though they can temporarily lessen pain by taking it from someone, they are unable to cure whatever is causing the pain. However, his mother had told him that his ability is a gift for someone special in his life.\n\nTheir distant relative Sui greeted them and showed them around the school, where they met the bookworm Ayame and Touka, who had an angelic smile. They are the only students at the school and this suited the siblings just fine since they wanted to avoid contact with people as much as possible. Gradually, he learned about the ‘pain’ that each girl had. Sui had an injured leg, while Ayame suffered from her parent’s deaths in a traffic accident. His own sister Ren didn’t trust anyone, relying only on him. However, Touka’s pain is on a totally different scale – just touching her had pain shooting through his body. This is the beginning of a tale of love and sacrifice.\n\n[Edited from [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/december-2012-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

And Toshiki's got a mission in mind rather than just a change of address: to get his creative mojo back, reignite that spark he once had.\n\nBack in the day, Toshiki had a childhood best friend named Ayase Aisa.\nThey were two peas in a pod, constantly pushing each other to be their best regarding their creative pursuits. However, as time passed, Toshiki increasingly felt they were on different pages. Later on, Aisa moved to Tokyo due to family circumstances.\n\nEven though they were miles apart, Toshiki and Aisa kept in touch by sending letters about their lives and exchanging the novels they had written. However, when Aisa started school, she suddenly ghosted Toshiki, completely cutting off communication without explanation and leaving him in the dark.\n\nNonetheless, Toshiki wasn't about to throw in the towel on his creative hustle. He kept grinding, making indie games, and even hitting it big with his first published light novel.\n\nToshiki was on a roll, levelling up as a creator, but about half a year ago, something knocked him off his game. He found himself stuck with the writer's block. Then it hit him - maybe if he surrounded himself with other creators his age, it could be the spark he needed to regain his mojo. That's when he set his sights on Saika Academy, a private school in Tokyo that brings together creators from diverse fields.\n\nAs spring arrived, Toshiki successfully passed the entrance exam for Saika Academy. He moved to Tokyo, ready to start this new chapter. \n\nBut then, in a twist of fate, Toshiki unexpectedly bumped into Aisa, his long-lost childhood friend, in the city's heart.\n\n[Translated and edited from the [url=http://ainolinks.com/]official website[/url]]",

      "description": "One day, our hero is headed home from Akihabara when he's mistaken for a molester. The person accusing him is his childhood friend, Akiyoshi Fuyuka. When they were both children, she was a well-dressed and lovely young rich girl, and the idol of the class. She was the apple of every boy's eye, but it was impossible to get close to her, our hero included. But our hero was in love with her. He has memories of when he was younger and first felt that way.\n\nBefore long, they ended up parting ways due to going to different middle schools. Our hero thinks that she might have been his first love. He didn't actually molest her, but all she will say to him is: \"If you want me to forgive you, then become my butler!\" These two recently reunited people end up in an unusual relationship as their unusual story begins once again...\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961760/]Steam[/url]]",

      "description": "Koinosu ☆ Ichacolize is all about building a ‘love nest’ where you can be lovey-dovey with your ideal girlfriend. After choosing your heroine and deciding on your name (default is Masakage) at the beginning, the game branches off into three separate routes which all take place in the same setting (your apartment), although with different story backgrounds. Ichika is a servile waitress who catches your eye at a café that you frequent. Sachi is a petite girl who you used to play with and with whom you were entrusted on days when she attends a cram school nearby. Natsume is the imouto of your next door neighbour who temporarily lives there when her older sister studies abroad.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/march-2017-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "The “City of Water”, Amemadoi, was built on a man-made island and boasts a beautiful and gorgeous cityscape. The lone wolf Eishi and his bizarre imouto Yuura and polite and kind childhood friend Sayo each have their own problems, as is the case with the hero-admiring kouhai Yurugi and cool Kukuri, who he found stuffed in a trash can in an alleyway. Various events and expectations were waiting ahead for these individuals with wounded hearts, such as playing concentration with the club room on the line, playing old maid with a girl who had been cast off, making up for what has been lost while watching the fireworks with fascination.\n\nDespite his disposition, Eishi vowed to bring a happy end for everyone. One where everyone would be able to smile. He would do it in his own way, working hard to attain an uncertain goal. This is the beginning of a story about growing up in a city where tears have been lost.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/march-2017-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochiakeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Subarashiki Hibi is a story told in seven chapters. The story follows a group of several Tokyo high school students mostly through July of 2012 and each chapter is told from the perspective of one of its five main characters. Because of the same timeframe coverage, certain events are overlapping from chapter to chapter but at the core of it all is a mystery revolving around the prophecy about the end of the world on July the 20th as well as the events that are following before the said date. The first part of the VN is used to make a setting for the said mysteries while the second part is about uncovering the truth behind them all.\n\nThe story begins in chapter #1, 'Down the Rabbit-Hole I\" on July 12, 2012. The protagonist, Minakami Yuki, lives a peaceful everyday life with Tsukasa and Kagami, her childhood friends, when one day she meets a mysterious girl, Takashima Zakuro (a girl in another class in Yuki's school, who seems to have met Yuki before but Yuki doesn't remember her). The strange schoolmate Yuki just befriended moves into her house (Yuki doesn't mind too much about that). Then following this new guest in Minakami's residence, Yuki's two childhood friends mentioned earlier also move in, just so that they don't feel left out. These events are just a prelude for what will ultimately lead Yuki to discover her own \"Wonderful Everyday\" during this chapter.\n\nIn chapter #2, [spoiler]\"Down the Rabbit-Hole II\", the story still follows Minakami Yuki in the same timeline as before albeit with a different set of events and their outcomes. This time, Yuki learns that Takashima Zakuro has killed herself. Rumours in school are abuzz about predictions of the end of the world in 2012 - one of which is a Web site called the \"Web Bot Project\", a network of crawlers designed to harness the 'collective unconsciousness' to make predictions. A boy in Yuki's class named Mamiya Takuji stands up and makes an apocalyptic prediction, stating that the world will end on the 20th, that Zakuro's death was the first sign. He speaks of an event he dubs \"the End Sky\", where the world will be destroyed and reborn. The clock is ticking and more people die as the prophesied date draws closer and closer while Yuki attempts to get to the bottom of the identity of Mamiya Takuji, the Web Bot Project and the End Sky.[/spoiler]\n\n[Edited from Asceai's [url=http://www.menhelmate.org/2010/04/subarashiki-hibi-furenzoku-sonzai.html]review[/url]]",
